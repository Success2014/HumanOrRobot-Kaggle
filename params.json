Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.\r\n\r\nIn order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by \"robots\", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity. \r\n\r\n## My Approach\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-65242930-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
